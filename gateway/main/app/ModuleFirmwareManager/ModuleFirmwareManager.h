// Keeps the PCB1246 running the firmware this gateway build carries.
//
// The release build links the PCB1246's .bin into this app image (see the
// PCB1246_FIRMWARE block in main/CMakeLists.txt), so one OTA of the gateway is an
// update of both boards: the gateway is the only thing that can flash the LPC, and it
// holds the image that belongs with the code that talks to it.
//
// On boot, and on `module update`, a task of its own:
//
//   1. resets the module into its boot ROM's ISP mode (ISP held through a reset);
//   2. compares the 32-byte image info at 0x300 in the module's flash with the same
//      bytes of the carried image (the PCB1246's ImageInfo.c). The ROM compares them
//      itself, so nothing is read back. Equal means "already running this build";
//      anything else -- another build, the old KC2 firmware, an erased part -- is
//      flashed. A part that does not answer at all is reported, not retried;
//   3. if flashing: erases what the image covers, sector 0 included, writes every
//      page but the first, then the first. Until that last page lands the part has
//      no valid image, so its boot ROM stays in ISP, and an update cut short is simply
//      found different and done again on the next boot;
//   4. resets the module out of ISP into whatever it now holds.
//
// The module is reset on every gateway boot by step 1. Its OpenTherm lines are idle
// for that second, while the gateway that answers them is booting anyway.
//
// An application manager because it drives board hardware (the module's UART and its
// reset and ISP lines), which only the application layer has.
