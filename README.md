# KC-OT-Poc

Proof of concept for OpenTherm on the KC1245 gateway and the PCB1246 OpenTherm plug-in board, rebuilt from scratch on the Strux framework. Lives at [KooleControls/KC-OT-Poc](https://github.com/KooleControls/KC-OT-Poc).

- `gateway/`: ESP32 firmware for the KC1245 gateway. A copy of [Strux](https://github.com/vanBassum/Strux) at commit `3c2e4ca`.
- `opentherm/`: LPC11U68 firmware for the PCB1246 (bare metal, no RTOS, Strux-style). Laid out like the gateway: the board, the Strux command/settings/system managers, and the OpenTherm modem with its link to the gateway.

Each folder holds its full source; nothing is shared between the two.

Decided so far:
- The LPC runs bare metal: one main loop, interrupts only set flags and fill buffers. No RTOS.
- The gateway and the PCB1246 talk over the UART using the Strux channel protocol instead of KC2.
- On the UART, each channel frame is COBS-framed with a CRC-16: `0x00 | COBS(frame | crc16) | 0x00`. A frame that fails the check is dropped and counted. The code is `lib/protocol/SerialFraming.h`, meant to be the same file on both sides.
- The PCB1246 is a modem and does not look inside a frame. Frames from either line go to the gateway on a stream the PCB1246 opens (`opentherm stream`); the gateway sends with `opentherm send side=<thermostat|boiler> frame=<uint32>`. Everything else is the gateway's.
- The gateway keeps the PCB1246's firmware up to date. A release builds `opentherm/` first and links its `.bin` into the gateway app, so one gateway OTA updates both boards. At boot, `ModuleFirmwareManager` resets the module into its ISP bootloader and compares the 32-byte image info at 0x300 (version, length, CRC-32, written by `tools/lpc_image_info.py`) with the image it carries. On a mismatch it flashes, with page 0 written last. `module status` / `module update`; the `module.update` setting turns the boot check off.
- The gateway's end of the modem link is `ModuleLinkManager`. It runs the same framing and handshake as the module, sends `opentherm send` requests, and records the module's frame stream, plus what it sent, in a ring of the last 256 frames. The web UI's OpenTherm page polls that ring with `module frames after=<seq>`, decodes each frame for display (`frontend/src/lib/opentherm.ts`), and can compose and send one. The module's UART is shared with `ModuleFirmwareManager` under its lock; after every ISP session the link starts over.
- What the proof of concept does with OpenTherm is still open.

## Build

Gateway, board `pcb1245`, with ESP-IDF 6.0:

```sh
cd gateway
idf.py -DBOARD=pcb1245 set-target esp32
idf.py -DBOARD=pcb1245 build
```

OpenTherm board, board `pcb1246`, with the Arm GNU Toolchain (`arm-none-eabi-gcc`, on PATH or in its default Windows install folder), CMake 3.20+, Ninja and Python 3:

```sh
cd opentherm
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```

Output in `opentherm/build/`: `opentherm.elf`, `.hex`, `.bin` and `.map`, with the LPC boot checksum and the image info already patched in.

Build `opentherm/` before `gateway/`: the gateway build embeds `opentherm/build/opentherm.bin` when it exists, and warns and leaves the module alone when it does not (`-DPCB1246_FIRMWARE=<path>` points it elsewhere).

## Release

Push a tag `vX.Y.Z` (or `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` for a pre-release). `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds both boards, checks that both report the tag's version, and publishes the gateway app and factory images plus the PCB1246 `.bin`/`.hex`. Running the workflow by hand builds the same files as artifacts without releasing.
